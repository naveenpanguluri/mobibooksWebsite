                    <strong>Privacy Statement</strong>
                    <p>SMSZONE understands the importance of your privacy. At SMSZONE we are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. If and when SMSZONE collects personal identifying information, we maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of that personal information obtained from our users. We do not share nor disclose personal information to any party beyond the SMSZONE network. For your own protection, please review the following terms and conditions before joining SMSZONE. We want you to enjoy SMSZONE to the fullest, but we also want you to stay informed. Through subscribing to SMSZONE, you are agreeing to our terms and conditions.</p>
                    <strong>Terms and conditions of use</strong>
                    <p>Your use of SMSZONE.in, the SMSZONE Mobile means that you agree to the terms and conditions outlined below. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, do not continue to use any of the SMSZONE properties. We reserve the right to change, modify and or remove portions of these terms at any time. If you choose to continue your use of this site after we have posted changes to the terms, it means you have accepted those terms. SMSZONE will not share your email address with anyone else without your permission.</p>
                    <strong>What kind of information does SMSZONE request and why is it necessary?</strong>
                    <p>All identifying information SMSZONE requests from the user is strictly kept confidential within the SMSZONE network. Personally identifying information SMSZONE asks for includes: your name, gender, birth date, zip code and e-mail address. When you register as a member of SMSZONE, we ask for your honest responses to this information so that we can serve you more efficiently and effectively. SMSZONE will not sell, rent nor disclose any of this personal information without your prior notification or consent. Further information we may ask for is strictly optional and thereby available publicly to other SMSZONE subscribers. Such optional information may include but is not limited to your hobbies and personal interests. This information is entered into your personal profile page and may be accessed by other SMSZONE members. Both your personal and optional information will help customize and enrich your SMSZONE experience by allowing us to send Group and Channel information to you based upon your entries. Our intention in requesting your personal information is so that we may provide you with opportunities by specifically directing Groups, Channels, and advertisements that reflect your interests. While you are receiving information directly to your account, advertisers never see or have access to your individual account information. If we are required by law, or feel a user will benefit, we may send you e-mail notices about products, companies and events. Always keep in mind, however, that any information you disclose on the Internet through e-mail, message boards or chat rooms, runs the risk of being collected by a third party, resulting in unsolicited e-mail messages or advertisements.</p>
                    <strong>What exactly are cookies?</strong>
                    <p>So that SMSZONE can provide you with thorough and personalized service, we use cookies to keep and occasionally track information about you. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. The use of cookies is an industry standard, you'll find them at most every major website. SMSZONE sometimes uses cookies to track info for our users' convenience and to understand our customers better. The cookies that are gathered by SMSZONE are only used within the SMSZONE network; at no time will we share that information with another service. Please note that you could be directed to another site while using SMSZONE. Links to other sites from ours are outside our network. These services may send their own cookies to users and otherwise collect data or solicit personal information.</p>
                    <strong>A word on content</strong>
                    <p>Through your SMSZONE account, we provide you with unfiltered access to other people's content. We cannot guarantee the quality, nor do we wish to control the content with which you will have contact. Naturally, not all content will agree with and appeal to each individual user. Another user's content may be offensive, harmful or inaccurate; please use discretion in understanding that user information. Content from an individual member's page or site does not reflect the opinion and intentions of SMSZONE. SMSZONE maintains the right to suspend membership or terminate an account that is considered to be the cause of harm or interference with our rights or property, SMSZONE members and users, or any individual that may suffer from such inappropriate activities. Furthermore, we may disclose user information when required to do so by law.</p>
                    <strong>How does an IP work?</strong>
                    <p>An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you surf the Web. Web servers are able to identify your computer by its IP address. SMSZONE does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable as an individual. This means that the users session will be kept on record, but the users personally identifying information (PII) remains anonymous. Personally Identifying Information, such as your name, address, phone number, date of birth, medical records and financial reports are not gathered through an IP address.</p>
                    <strong>"SPAM"</strong>
                    <p>Distributing or taking any action with unsolicited commercial messages (spam) through another web site or account is a strict offense. SMSZONE may use anti spam techniques, without prior consent, to stop your messages and prevent them from delivery.</p>
                    <strong>Does SMSZONE protect my privacy?</strong>
                    <p>Your SMSZONE account is password-protected, meaning only you have access to your account-related information. If you refrain from sharing your password with others, you can help us to continue this security and confidentiality. Remember to log out of your SMSZONE account when you are finished. By doing so, you protect your information from being re-opened by another person if you are using a shared or public computer. Please note that neither SMSZONE nor any other Internet service can promise complete privacy. The Internet is not yet 100% secure, therefore it is recommended that you take care with the information you choose to provide on any online service.</p>
                    <strong>Appropriate online conduct and content</strong>
                    <p>With the exception of private text messages and e-mail, anytime you publish through SMSZONE, upload to and/or distribute information through our service, you are granting SMSZONE the right to copy, edit, delete, and distribute such works.
